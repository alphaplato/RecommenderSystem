This is a scalable recommendation system.   
Recommendation algorithms have gradually become a relatively mature algorithm field after years of development. Although the recommendation algorithm is not a new technology, in the process of working, it is found that for small and medium-sized companies, our recommendation system still faces a lot of costs. On the one hand, the push system as a whole is relatively complex, and on the other hand, the degree of customization of the systems provided by recommendation system service providers on the market cannot meet the functional and personalized needs of the enterprise.   
Based on the technology of recommendation system that I have been working on for many years, I have compiled a relatively universal, mini, and scalable general system, aiming to help small and medium-sized enterprises build recommendation systems quickly and at low cost.
