# Introduction
This is an extensible recommendation system that has undergone years of development in recommendation algorithms, becoming a relatively mature technical field. Although recommendation systems are widely used in large companies, building a recommendation system still poses significant challenges for small and medium-sized enterprises. The overall complexity of the system, coupled with the limited customization offered by recommendation system service providers in the market, fails to meet the personalized functional needs of enterprises.

To address this issue, I have compiled a relatively universal, compact, and extensible recommendation system based on my years of experience in the recommendation system industry. The system aims to assist small and medium-sized enterprises in building their own recommendation systems quickly and cost-effectively to meet their specific business requirements.

# Key Features
Versatility: Suitable for various recommendation scenarios, including product recommendations, content recommendations, etc.
Compact Scale: The system is designed to be simple and lightweight, reducing maintenance and operational costs.
Scalability: Flexible expansion and customization according to business needs to meet the personalized requirements of different enterprises.
